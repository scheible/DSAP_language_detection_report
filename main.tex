The abstract should appear at the top of the left-hand column of text, about
0.5 inch (12 mm) below the title area and no more than 3.125 inches (80 mm) in
length.  Leave a 0.5 inch (12 mm) space between the end of the abstract and the
beginning of the main text.  The abstract should contain about 100 to 150
words, and should be identical to the abstract text submitted electronically
along with the paper cover sheet.  All manuscripts must be in English, printed

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

Spoken language identification is to classify the spoken language from a given audio sample, which is typically the first step for language processing tasks. Without spoken language detection, speech utterances cannot be analysed correctly and the grammar rules cannot be applied. As with speech recognition, humans can perform the most accurate language identification. Within a few seconds of hearing, people are able to identify if they have prior knowledge of this language. In the other case, people can just make subjective judgements to the similarity of the language they know.

There are several critical applications for spoken language identification, such as international emergency call for urgent occasions and language predefine for intelligent assistants like Siri. 
Thus, a spoken language identification system should be developed for such cases.

In our project, we explore two different approaches, Phoneme Statistical Analysis (PSA) and Deep Neural Network (DNN), to identifying the language of speech. Five languages, Arabic, Dutch, Korean, Polish and Romanian from \texttt{Topcoder}. are used as database. The inputs are 10  seconds audio segment files in type of “wav.” and outputs are the label of the language. In the PSA approach, we extract the phonemes and build a statistical analysis model for each language. While in DNN approach, we transform information from the audio signal to Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCC) and use Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) to train the system.

The report is structured in the following way: In Sect 2 we introduce the system of PSA. The approach with DNN will be shown in Sect.3. Finally, in Sect. 4 we conclude our work with comparison of both systems.

\section{REFERENCES}
\label{sec:refs}

List and number all bibliographical references at the end of the
paper. The references can be numbered in alphabetic order or in
order of appearance in the document. When referring to them in
the text, type the corresponding reference number in square
brackets as shown at the end of this sentence \cite{C2}. An
additional final page (the fifth page, in most cases) is
allowed, but must contain only references to the prior
literature.

% References should be produced using the bibtex program from suitable
% BiBTeX files (here: strings, refs, manuals). The IEEEbib.bst bibliography
% style file from IEEE produces unsorted bibliography list.
